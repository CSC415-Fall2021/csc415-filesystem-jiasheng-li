Love is a set of emotions, behaviors, and beliefs with strong feelings of
affection. So, for example, a person might say he or she loves his or her
dog, loves freedom, or loves God. The concept of love may become an
unimaginable thing and also it may happen to each person in a particular
way.
Love has a variety of feelings, emotions, and attitude. For someone love
is more than just being interested physically in another one, rather it is an
emotional attachment. We can say love is more of a feeling that a person
feels for another person. Therefore, the basic meaning of love is to feel
more than liking towards someone.
We know that the desire to love and care for others is a hard-wired and
deep-hearted because the fulfillment of this wish increases the happiness
level. Expressing love for others benefits not just the recipient of
affection, but also the person who delivers it. The need to be loved can
be considered as one of our most basic and fundamental needs.
One of the forms that this need can take is contact comfort. It is the desire
to be held and touched. So, there are many experiments showing that
babies who are not having contact comfort, especially during the first six
months, grow up to be psychologically damaged.
